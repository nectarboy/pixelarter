# pixelarter

## an introduction
pixelarter is a small pixel art program for the GBA !<br>
theres a DS version as well but its pretty shitty :|

its pretty primitive and a lil tedious at times- <br>
it uses bitmaps instead of tiles :| and it lacks some qol features like holding down directions.

ooh also u cant rlly save ur work srry :( maybe with saves tho ... hm ...

## GBA controls
pixel arter is very simple to use :D<br>
as soon as you start, you are presented with a blank canvas uwu

the controls are as following:
```
  - MOVE            D-Pad
  - DRAW            Button A
  - ERASE           Button B
  - SWITCH COLOR    Buttons R / L
  - CLEAR CANVAS    Select
```

## DS controls
this pixel arter is fucking shit. utter garbage.<br>
youre better off using a GBA hypervisor if ur planning to use this on ur DS.<br>
if ur gonna use this version anyways i hope u like hot neon lime.

the controls are as following:
```
  - MOVE            D-Pad
  - DRAW            Button A
  - ERASE           Button B
  - CLEAR CANVAS    Button X
```

## building
to build these from source, u need devkitpro.<br>
- you need the devkitpro version for the console ur building for ofc.

then you can open the folder of pixelarter-[console] and do `make` !

though are u rlly gonna do all that for some dumbass pixelart program ...<br>
just go and download the binaries for ur own sake.
